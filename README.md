# Midi2txt

Repository to read Midi files and extract track information. The script "bill-midi" uses then Standard MIDI from and to text (smf2txt) from http://grfia.dlsi.ua.es/gen.php?id=resources, and organizes the outputs into folders by authors. The script "concatenate-smf2txt" joins all .txt ouputs by author and cleans the spurious data.
